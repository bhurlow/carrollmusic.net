    <p class="bio"> Minneapolis’ Carroll (two R’s, two L’s) was born in late 2011 when frontman Brian Hurlow started composing melancholic pop songs that caught the ear of college classmate and drummer Charlie Rudoy. The lifelong musicians clicked and moved in together to a house on Carroll Avenue, coining the psychedelic, shoegazey-pop band’s name. After guitarist Max Kulicke and bassist Charles McLung came on board for the live show, Carroll started turning heads.  </p>
    <p class="bio"> Since the release of their Needs EP, they’ve become a mainstay on The Current, the Twin Cities’s triple A NPR affiliate station, and were named Best New Band by the two biggest local arts publications. In February of 2014, the band escaped the frigid Minnesota winter to Philly’s Miner Street Recordings where they cut their debut full-length in 17 days with the expertise of engineer Jonathan Low, who’s produced albums for the National, (Mr.) Twin Sister, and Local Natives. With Brian’s subdued yet distinct vocals accompanied by punctual drums and alluring riff vignettes, Carroll’s self-titled debut will leave you bewitched. </p>
    <p class="bio"> Carroll has opened for bands like Dr. Dog, Pure Bathing Culture, Gardens & Villa, Electric Six and many more. The band announced their first batch of lives dates for the summer including Minneapolis’ 10 Thousand Sounds Festival including acts Poliça (Mom + Pop) and Sylvan Esso (Partisan) on the bill. Carroll will embark on a national tour this October in support of the release of their full-length debut ending with showcases at the CMJ Festival in New York City. </p>
