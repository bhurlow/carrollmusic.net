		"Songs from the record are already in rotation at The Current on MPR, who called them "among the freshest tracks we've heard come from the Twin Cities in a while." No arguments here. Carroll's song structures are immaculate, but that doesn't hold back subtle and powerful emotional resonance they bring. The melancholy yet bright tracks use melodies like tides, inevitable and simple yet imminently mysterious."

			"Needs is a perfectly crafted indie-pop gem. Lead singer Hurlow's light voice is wired to the dreamy five tracks on the EP, a deliberate mash-up of noise and art. It's the kind of thing the indie music blogosphere and world at large will eat up -- songs that recognize their own irony and shrug it off."
